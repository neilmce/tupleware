Notes
===

This module is not exported by the tupleware project and is only used when compiling Tupleware.

It defines a single annotation type,
[TupleGeneration](src/main/java/com/neil/tupleware/annotations/TupleGeneration.java), which is used
by a Java annotation processor,
[TupleProcessor](src/main/java/com/neil/tupleware/annotations/TupleProcessor.java) to _generate_ most
of the code exposed by this library.
